# 🌌 Lumino: 1D Universe Simulation

Lumino is a 1D universe simulation where you can explore the dynamics of a living ecosystem in a one-dimensional space. The simulation allows you to interact with and visualize a universe of creatures that can be alive or represent empty spaces.

## 🚀 Goal

The goal of Lumino is to provide a platform for experimenting with and observing the behavior of simple creatures in a one-dimensional universe. Users can customize the size of the universe, the number of creatures, and interact with the simulation to study emergent patterns.

## 🌟 Current Implementation - 2023-12-21

- The universe is represented by a one-dimensional array.
- Each element in the array has properties such as ID and status (alive or empty).
- The visualization uses Pygame to display the universe on a window.
- Creatures are represented by green pixels, and empty spaces are black.
- Hovering over an alive creature displays information and a small menu with properties.
